Manage Sessions
--------------

This is a module for Axiom CMS applications that lets you control the sessions of the users from within the CMS.
It shows you the start time of the session, how long it should last for, end time, and even allows you to log that session out.


Usage
------

To use this module just put the code in your modules directory.

<axiom root>/modules

Then, make sure to add the module to your list of modules in your app.properties file, but put it after the cms module.
